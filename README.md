# üü¢ Tumor Detection and MGMT Status Classification from MRI

This project implements and evaluates an **object detection pipeline** (based on **Faster R-CNN / PyTorch**)  
for **brain tumor localization and MGMT promoter status classification** using **MRI axial slices**.

The model simultaneously:
- Detects tumor **bounding boxes**,  
- Classifies their **MGMT status** (`MGMT+` or `MGMT‚àí`).

The focus of this work is to evaluate **spatial vs. label precision** ‚Äî  
how well the model knows *where* a tumor is versus *what* type it is.

## üìò Overview

MRI data are processed slice-by-slice (axial orientation) and passed to a **Faster R-CNN** model trained to predict:
- Bounding boxes around tumors
- Class labels indicating MGMT methylation status

Main evaluation metrics:
- **Spatial Precision / Recall** : IoU-based detection accuracy (positioning of boxes)  
- **Label Precision / Recall** : correctness of predicted tumor class (MGMT+ / MGMT‚àí)

A custom evaluation module computes:
- PR curves vs. **score threshold**  
- Separate metrics for **spatial** and **label** performance  
- Confusion matrices for both types of predictions

## üß† Key Results (Axial-only)

| Metric Type | Precision | Recall | Interpretation |
|:-------------|:----------:|:---------:|:-----------------------------|
| **Spatial (IoU ‚â• 0.5)** | 0.935 | 0.889 | Excellent tumor localization |
| **Label (MGMT+/‚àí)** | 0.468 | 0.444 | Moderate label accuracy bc limited by single-axis input |

> These results are consistent with expectations:  
> Using only **axial slices** limits the available 3D and textural information  
> necessary to accurately distinguish MGMT methylation status.

## üßæ Notes

- **NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression)** is applied before evaluation to ensure reliable detection metrics.  
- Precision and recall are reported **separately for spatial and label correctness**.  
- The visualization utility allows direct comparison between **ground truth** and **predicted** boxes.  
- Dataset loading and transformations follow the **TorchVision detection pipeline** standards.

## üöÄ Future Work

The next step of this project is to **extend the model to 3D-aware inference**,  
combining **axial, coronal, and sagittal** planes simultaneously.  
This multi-axis approach is expected to significantly improve **label precision** by  
providing richer spatial and textural context for tumor characterization.
